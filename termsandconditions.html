                acts of the Doctor/registered medical practitioners. Healthcare Services: All of the Treating Providers who deliver Services through My medi helper are independent professionals solely responsible for the services each provides to you.
                My medi helper does not practice medicine or any other licensed profession, and does not interfere with the practice of medicine or any other licensed profession by Treating Providers, each of whom is responsible for his or her services
                and compliance with the requirements applicable to his or her profession and license. Neither My medi helper nor any third parties who promote the Services or provide you with a link to the Service shall be liable for any professional
                advice you obtain from a Treating Provider via the Services. Informed Consent: The telehealth Services you receive from Treating Providers are not intended to replace a primary care physician relationship or be your permanent medical home.
                You should seek emergency help or follow-up care when recommended by a Treating Provider or when otherwise needed and continue to consult with your primary care physician and other healthcare professionals as recommended. You will have
                direct access to customer support services to follow up on medication reactions, side effects or other adverse events. Among the benefits of our Services are improved access to healthcare professionals and convenience. However, as with
                any health service, there are potential risks associated with the use of telehealth. These risks include, but may not be limited to: � In rare cases, information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow
                for appropriate health care decision making by the Treating Provider; � Delays in evaluation or treatment could occur due to failures of the electronic equipment. If this happens, you may be contacted by phone or other means of communication.
                In rare cases, a lack of access to all of your health records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors; � Although the electronic systems we use will incorporate network and software security
                protocols to protect the privacy and security of health information, in rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal health information By accepting these Terms of Use, you acknowledge that you
                understand and agree with the following: You understand that you may expect the anticipated benefits from the use of telehealth in your care, but that no results can be guaranteed or assured. You understand that the laws that protect the
                privacy and security of health information apply to telehealth, and have received Netmed�s Notice of Privacy Practices, which describes these protections in more detail. Electronic communications are directed to your Treating Provider(s)
                and their supervisees through a secure, encrypted video interface and electronic health record. Your Treating Provider may determine that the Services are not appropriate for some or all of your treatment needs, and accordingly may elect
                not to provide telehealth services to you through the Site. With respect to psychotherapy, you are entitled to receive information from your Treating Provider about the methods of therapy, the techniques used, the duration of your therapy
                (if known), and the fee structure. You can seek a second opinion from another therapist or terminate therapy at any time. With respect to psychotherapy, if you and your Treating Provider decide to engage in group or couples therapy (collectively
                �Group Therapy�), you understand that information discussed in Group Therapy is for therapeutic purposes and is not intended for use in any legal proceedings involving Group Therapy participants. You agree not to subpoena the Treating
                Provider to testify for or against other Group Therapy participants or provide records in court actions against other Group Therapy participants. You understand that anything any Group Therapy participant tells the Treating Provider individually,
                whether on the phone or otherwise, may at the therapist�s discretion be shared with the other Group Therapy participants. You agree to share responsibility with the Treating Provider for the therapy process, including goal setting and
                termination. You can send messages to your Treating Provider by contacting My medi helper Customer Support. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, you should call the emergency ambulance number or go to the nearest emergency room.
